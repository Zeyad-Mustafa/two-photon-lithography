  IP-Dip is the gold standard photoresist for two-photon lithography.
  
  ADVANTAGES:
  - Excellent resolution (< 200 nm)
  - High sensitivity (low threshold power)
  - Fast writing speed possible
  - Well-characterized and documented
  - Commercial support available
  
  DISADVANTAGES:
  - Expensive (~50 EUR/mL)
  - Moderate shrinkage (12%)
  - Requires careful storage
  - Limited shelf life once opened
  
  BEST FOR:
  - High-resolution structures
  - Photonic crystals
  - Prototype development
  - Research applications
  
  For large structures or production, consider IP-S (lower cost, faster)
  For low shrinkage, consider Ormocomp (<5% shrinkage)
